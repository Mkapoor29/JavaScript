If you need to type multiple lines of code before you run them, make sure to press the SHIFT + ENTER shortcut key to get onto the next line.
Notice the distinction between pressing the ENTER key to run the JavaScript code you've typed, versus pressing the SHIFT + ENTER shortcut to move onto the next line of code (rather than running the code you've already typed up).
##you can style the output in the console?
-->In this code snippet, there are a few additions: the font size is different and the color is blue: 
```
console.log("%cHello, World", "color: blue; font-size: 40px");
```
If you add the %c right after the " character, you can then style the console output by adding the , character after the second ", and then, inside another pair of " and " characters, use valid CSS code to style the words you want to output in the console.
